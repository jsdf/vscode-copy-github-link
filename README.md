# copy-github-link

Copy the GitHub link of a code snippet, no extra configuration needed.

## Fork Changes

This fork generates GitHub links to the main branch instead of specific commit hashes. The extension automatically detects the primary branch name (`main`, `master`, etc.) and creates stable links that always point to the current version of the code.
